Package structure
=====================================================

TinyCarControllerAdvance - Root of the package.
    Contains this help file and the documentation in pdf format.
Scripts

    Scripts/Helpers - Scripts that take care of input, camera, and effects.
    Scripts/Internal - Scripts used by the scripts above. Not to be used on their own.
Examples - Example scenes with different use cases.

=====================================================
Getting started
=====================================================

The basics

1) Create an empty GameObject in your scene.
2) Add the script at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Scripts/Core/TCCAPlayer.cs' to the GameObject.
3) Add your car model to the empty GameObject. Make sure you have one object per wheel and one for the body, and that they are separated.
4) Add the script at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Scripts/Core/TCCABody.cs' to the car body object.
5) Add the script at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Scripts/Core/TCCAWheel.cs' to each of the car's wheel objects.
6) Set the parameters of the body and wheel scripts to your liking.

For input

1) Add the script at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Scripts/Helpers/TCCAStandardInput.cs' to an empty GameObject.
2) Drag and drop the player object to the "Car Controller" field.
3) Set each input action to the desired key or button.

For the camera

1) Add the script at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Scripts/Helpers/TCCACamera.cs' to your camera GameObject.
2) Drag and drop the player object to the "Car Controller" field.
3) Adjust the parameters to define the behavior of the camera relative to the vehicle.

=====================================================
Tips
=====================================================

- Fields tooltips and contextual tips in the editor explain each parameter's functionality.
- Don't be afraid to experiment with parameter values to find the right behavior for your needs.
- Check out the example scene at 'Assets/DavidJalbert/TinyCarControllerAdvance/Examples/ExampleSandbox.unity'.
- You can open the helper scripts in your code editor to see how they work, and learn how to code your own.
- Don't forget to read documentation.pdf !
